Dear ENTROPY Community:

It has been two months without an update from me. I hope the wait has been worth it.

Today, we launch an art collection on DRiP called [Phantasmagoria by ENTROPY](https://drip.haus/entropy). Our first collectible piece "Miners Dig Holes" is available to anyone for the cost of minting a compressed NFT on Solana&mdash;just one cent&mdash;and can be secured through our DRiP page. Phantasmagoria is a natural extension of ENTROPY because, after all, ENTROPY itself is an art project.

I most like to describe ENTROPY as "an art project centered around a business that does nothing." Unlike in a traditional business, where the CEO seeks to increase revenue, my role here is quite constrained because our core network revenue must remain zero if we are to remain a Pure DePIN.

Designing business plans with the constraint that they be useless has been a fascinating challenge. In many ways, the task is futile&mdash;after all, entropy always wins in the end. However, we have thus far been able to deliver creative solutions at a regular cadence and forestall the inevitable.

Consider slogans such as Miners Eat First, Entropy Eats Every End, Miners Dig Holes. Reflect on community initiatives such as digging holes, naming and shaming, snakes and chairs. Or witness the ritualistic performance of tasks such as the flashing of microcontrollers, the wearing of lambo shades and, of course, the digging of useless holes. All of these provide value without the need for cash flows.

Some call ENTROPY a social experiment, but it is not that. Experiments are deconstructive, requiring hypothesis; ENTROPY, however, is driven by the entirely constructive aim to do nothing as effectively as possible.

This brings us to Phantasmagoria, a collection dedicated to those who eat first. Let your desire to sit at the head of the table guide you as you explore the collection. Always strive to do your best, even if what you are doing is really... nothing.

Miners eat first, \
Prof. Lambo
