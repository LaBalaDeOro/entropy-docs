# Tokenomics

All tokens in the ENTROPY network are mined by miners.

Miners pay a fee when claiming rewards, totaling 1/42 of tokens claimed.

Miners must claim tokens within 7 days. Tokens left unclaimed are automatically burned.

To begin, the network issues rewards totalling approximately 76 million tokens per day. This amount is halved yearly so that the maximum possible supply is no greater than 55.5 billion tokens, less any tokens that have been burned.
