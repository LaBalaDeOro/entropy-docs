# Tokenomics

All tokens in the ENTROPY network are mined by miners.

Miners pay a fee when claiming rewards, totaling 1/42 of tokens claimed. The fee funds a treasury that is controlled by members of the Pure DePIN team.

Miners must claim tokens within 7 days. Tokens left unclaimed are automatically burned. No fee is paid on burned tokens.

To begin, the network issues rewards totaling approximately 76 million tokens per day. This amount is halved yearly so that the maximum possible supply is no greater than 55.5 billion tokens, less any tokens that have been burned.

## The Second Law

According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, entropy in any isolated system may never decrease.

In the ENTROPY network, tokens may be withdrawn from a mining wallet. However, this may create a local entropy debt.

According to the Second Law of ENTROPY, the entropy debt created when tokens are withdrawn must be repaid by burning tokens, or by replenishing the token balance. **Therefore, new tokens can only be claimed if the number of tokens in the wallet has not been less than the total number of tokens claimed, minus the number of tokens burned, at any time during the past seven days.**

The impact of the Second Law is that it causes miners to think about their long-term participation in the network, but does not punish transfers outright. Miners may choose to withdraw a large a number of tokens, but must understand that their ability to claim may be curtailed, and any tokens they mine in the future may be burned through the automatic burn mechanism, until the entropy debt is repaid.

Whatever tokens are burned through the automatic burn mechanism are counted against the entropy debt, so if sufficient mining continues, the claim restriction will eventually be lifted.
