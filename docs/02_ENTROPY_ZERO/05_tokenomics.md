# Tokenomics

All tokens in the ENTROPY network are mined by miners.

Miners pay a fee when claiming rewards, totaling 1/42 of tokens claimed. The fee funds a treasury that is controlled by members of the Pure DePIN team.

Miners must claim tokens within 7 days. Tokens left unclaimed are automatically burned. No fee is paid on burned tokens.

To begin, the network issues rewards totaling approximately 76 million tokens per day. This amount is halved yearly so that the maximum possible supply is no greater than 55.5 billion tokens, less any tokens that have been burned.

## The Second Law

An interpretation of The Second Law of Thermodynamics is that entropy may only increase. The ENTROPY network has taken this interpretation a step further and implemented its own Second Law:

**Miners are not allowed to claim if the amount of tokens in their wallet has in the past seven days been less than the total amount they have ever claimed minus the total amount that has been burned on their behalf.**

The impact of The Second Law is that it causes miners to think about their long-term participation in the network but does not punish transfers outright. Miners may choose to transfer a large a number of tokens, but must understand that their ability to claim may be curtailed and any tokens they mine burned through the automatic burn mechanism.

Note that whatever tokens are burned are counted towards paying off a miner's "entropy debt" which counts towards lifting the restriction on claims.
