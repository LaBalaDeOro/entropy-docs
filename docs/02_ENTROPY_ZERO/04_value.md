# Relationship to value

The question of value is always at the forefront of individual minds. Why do we do what we do?

In a theoretical sense, the value of entropy is very much zero because  _maximal entropy is equivalent to nothingness_. However, this is completely definitional; there exists no requirement that a value function be lower-bounded by zero. At times, nothingness might be preferable to the fulfillment of an objective and this is particularly true in muli-agent sytems where individual agents' objectives often come into conflict.

## Market value

Turning our attention to market value, a rational market perspective would suggest that randomness should command a price of exactly zero. This is because entropy is the measure of a lack of information and there is no demand for information that does not lead to material advantage.

However, this does not preclude demand for the _process of generating entropy_. That is, we can still value the process of doing nothing even if the nothing we produce has no value on its own.

## Memecoins

Valuing nothingness above rationally justified expected value is a type of _nihilism_. In finance, the trading of memecoins, which are finanical instruments that have no use outside of themselves, represents nihilism in its purest form.

With no intrinsic value to the data it mines, ENTROPY is therefore a memecoin.

## DePIN coins

The entire DePIN sector is novel and its value is questionable. Fortunes will be made and lost identifying the truly valuable aspects of DePIN. Fortunes will also be made and lost identifying what is not truly valuable but what market participants might value at a particular time.

ENTROPY is all about serving as the zero bound on all the noise. There is no "intrinsic value" to the data that the ENTROPY network mines. Therefore, it is safe to say that any success of the ENTROPY network relates to its value as a DePIN project _per se_ and not the data it provides. 

ENTROPY may therefore serve as the DePIN lower bound:

**A DePIN project less successful than ENTROPY is by definition worth less than nothing.**
