# Get started

To join ENTROPY, one may apply for a DIY role by joining the Discord server:

https://discord.gg/minerseatfirst

Or [buy an Ashlar](https://justentropy.lol).

## Mining

### DIY 
With the DIY role, a miner is guaranteed at least one mining credential, allowing them to connect their mining device to the server. Each credential is uniquely linked to:

- A Solana address
- A firmware binary provided to the miner to be flashed on an ESP32 or ESP32-S3 device

See the [mining guides](../category/diy-guides) for instructions on how to flash.

### Ashlar
See the [mining guides](../category/ashlar_config) for instructions on how to set up the Ashlar.
