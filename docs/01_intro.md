# Welcome to Pure DePIN

Decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) are networks of physical infrastructure coordinated through the use of cryptocurrencies. Like the rest of web3, there exists an expectation that decentralizing trust and distributing coordination might lead to creation of value through improved economic growth and efficiency.

However, as with most of web3, expectations are generally driven by hype and it is currently very difficult to separate hope from reality. In particular, within DePIN, there prevails an attitude of ["if we build it, they will come,"](https://x.com/KyleSamani/status/1808941925795574130) i.e., that growth in supply of a technology justifies future demand for that same technology.

Does this even matter, though? From a market perspective, the answer is a resounding *no*. Markets are always right and who are we to say otherwise.

Pure DePIN embraces the supply-driven mantra and focuses purely on expanding DePIN supply. Whether it be mining for the sake of mining or promoting the interests of DePIN enthusiasts, Pure DePIN is there to satisfy the demand of the supply side before all else.
