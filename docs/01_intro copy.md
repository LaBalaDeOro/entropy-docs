# Welcome to Just ENTROPY

Crypto mining concerns itself with the distributed creation of currency via computing algorithms that range from fully decentralized to permissioned. One approach to this is that of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs), which coordinate physical field devices that earn rewards based on network needs.

Advocates claim DePINs unlock economic efficiencies and network effects that centralized systems cannot match. However, the focus on utility obfuscates a reality that permeates much&mdash;if not all&mdash;of web3: sometimes demand exists just for the token itself. In other words, *miners gonna mine*.

How do you separate demand for actual utility from demand for tokens as assets of their own? This is what ENTROPY is here to do. The ENTROPY network mines nothing but pure, valueless randomness. Its utility is literally zero and any token value it accrues exists entirely outside conventional notions of usefulness.

By this definition, ENTROPY is *art*, if art is everything that is not utility. It is also the lower bound of crypto: any project with a market cap below ENTROPY is doing less than nothing, but with extra steps.

So, keep your utility. Bring the non-utility home. Mine entropy, with ENTROPY.
