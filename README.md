# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static website generator.

## Getting Started

### Prereqs

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:

## Run

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

As you edit the markdown in the `/docs` directory, the site reloads automatically and displays your changes.
